### Architecture overview

This application is cross-platform at the server and client-side, thanks to .NET 6 services capable of running on Linux or Windows containers depending on your Docker host.
The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation using HTTP as the communication protocol between the client app and the microservice.
